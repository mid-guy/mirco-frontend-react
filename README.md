Micro Frontend Architecture
Micro Frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) that uses multiple components with their independent lifecycle. These components are usually integrated into the main application via an API gateway. Each component is developed by a different team and is deployed independently of the others.

This approach enables each team to work independently and iterate quickly without affecting the other teams. Additionally, it allows for a more granular scaling of the application as a whole. The main downside of this approach is that it can be more challenging to manage, as each team needs to be aware of the other teams' changes to avoid conflicts.

However, overall, micro frontends can provide a more flexible and scalable solution than traditional monolithic frontends.
